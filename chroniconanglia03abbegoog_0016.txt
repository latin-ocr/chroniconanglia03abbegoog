which the letter of 0110 refers, must have been
written before the year 1120, i. e. within thirty years
aiter Becket’s death. Yet, as this letter is not found
in the other MSS. of the Miranula, it strictly proves
no more than that the copyist oi* Sir Thomas Phillipps's
- MS. considered this collection to be the same which
odo sent for the use of his friends, as stated in the
letter aforesaid. Still this is one point gained; for
as Sir Thomas Philipps’s MS. was written about the
year 1300, it follows «hat the collection oi* MniAchA,
which it contains, was considered to be the work of
Benedict, as early as 500 years agol
Tu complete the argument, we have the evidence
of our author himself, in page 219, that, previously
to compiling this book of miracles, he had written a
book coneerning the Archbishop :

tractum illum sanguinis, de quo et in passione ejus fecimus
mentionem.

The inferenne, which we would endeavour to
establish, is rendered still more forcible from the
non-existence οἱ any other collection of Miracles
than that which we now publish. Five manuscripts,
at least, of them are in existence, all agreeing with
one another. These are

A. Budley MS* No 509, containing only the first 45 chapters.
Β. Paris MS. Biblinth. Nati-ml. (olim Regis),No 5³20. io. 69.
C. Lambeth MS. No 1³5.
